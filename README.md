# Exploits

There are two .html files available here.

The name of the first file is (Kill_CPU__SHOW.html), when the victim opens this file, it introduces itself as a game and asks the user for permission to open a new page (permission is not needed in old browsers), then to The infinite face opens itself in new pages (opens about 10-60 pages per second) and as time passes, the speed of opening pages increases and finally the system crashes!!!

The second file is called (Kill_RAM__HIDE.html). When the user enters this page, it injects 2 megabytes of information into the RAM infinitely and causes the system to hang and stop working (it may not work in systems with low internet speed).
